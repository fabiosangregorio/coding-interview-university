# Before you get started

## Use flashcards
Note on flashcards: The first time you recognize you know the answer, don't mark it as known. You have to see the same card and answer it several times correctly before you really know it. Repetition will put that knowledge deeper in your brain.

## Focus
There are a lot of distractions that can take up valuable time. Focus and concentration are hard. Turn on some music without lyrics and you'll be able to focus pretty well.

## The daily plan
Each day I take one subject from the list below, watch videos about that subject, and write an implementation in:
- C++
- Java
- Python

Write code on a whiteboard or paper, not a computer. Test with some sample inputs. Then test it out on a computer.
